     "description": "This article explores the fundamentals of React Hooks, a feature introduced in React 16.8 that allows developers to use state and other React features without writing a class. Starting with the basic useState hook, we dive into how it simplifies state management in functional components. The article also covers useEffect, which enables side-effects in function components, and demonstrates how to write custom hooks to abstract complex logic. By the end, readers will have a deep understanding of how hooks transform React development."
